//  Write a program that uses a structure to store the following data on a company division:
//
//      Division Name (such as East, West, North, or South)
//      First-Quarter Sales
//      Second-Quarter Sales
//      Third-Quarter Sales
//      Fourth-Quarter Sales
//      Total Annual Sales
//      Average Quarterly Sales
//
//  The program should use four variables of this structure. Each variable should represent
//  one of the following corporate divisions: East, West, North, and South. The user
//  should be asked for the four quarters' sales figures for each division. Each division's
//  total and average sales should be calculated and stored in the appropriate member of
//  each structure variable. These figures should then be displayed on the screen.
//
//  Input Validation: Do not accept negative numbers for any sales figures.
